# NFT WebApp
Web3 refers to decentralized webapps that use blockchains. <br />
In this project I have built a smart contact from scratch and interacted with it on the web using Ethers.js and Angular. <br />
On the the WebApp the user can mint NFTs with a wallet like MetaMask. <br />
There are various technologies involved, but the main idea is to access the API of a smart contract from a frontend web app using Angular.<br /> <br />
