init a front end app (react,angular...)
npx hardhat (create a contracts folder ".sol" files, create scripts folder, create test folder)
change hardhat.config.js file to add artifacts for frontend -> it adds a ABI middleman
npm install all needed dependencies (waffle automating testing, ethers for metamask, zeppzin for smartcontracts)
Create our smartcontract on openzeppelin in the browser and add the .sol file into contracts folder
change hardhat.config.js file by removing some require 
Go to ./test/sample-test.js and test before doing frontend stuff
Once testing is OK 
Go to ./scripts/sample-script.js and adapt to our smartcontract
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
create components for your frontend
